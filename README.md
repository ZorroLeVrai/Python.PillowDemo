# Pillow Demo

A basic demo for an introduction to the Pillow library.

The Pillow library provides image processing capabilities.  
It provides an extensive file format support, an efficient internal representation, and image processing capabilities.

`display_picture.py` shows how to display a picture.  
`file_to_picture.py` shows how to create a picture file from a stored file containing an array of tuples. Each of these tuples represents the RGB color of a pixel.  
`jpeg_to_colors.py` transforms a picture file to a file containing an array of tuples. Each of these tuples represents the RGB color of a pixel.  
`matplot_graph.py` saves a mathematical graph and displays it on the sreen using the `matplotlib` libray.
